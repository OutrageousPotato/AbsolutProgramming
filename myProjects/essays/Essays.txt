The most important component in a computer is the motherboard which is the thing to which all other components (CPU, RAM, graphics cards, expansion slots, peripherals) are connected. The CPU is the component that does all the actual data processing, one command at a time at a rate of billions per second. The timing of this activity is controlled by the clock, which instructs the CPU to execute its commands at regular intervals via discrete pulses of 5V of electricity. 

The CPU is connected to the RAM, a temporary storage container for data. As the clock pulses the CPU is able to execute commands about what to do with data that is in RAM using a data bus, which communicates specific commands and values, and an address bus, which communicates precisely where on the RAM the corresponding information is to be found or placed.

The CPU also contains the ALU which handles all math operations. Numbers are stored in binary form in groups of eight bits called a byte. A bit is one individual transistor set as on (electricity flowing) or off (electricity no flowing). Math is accomplished by special circuits which are basically combinations of different types of gates arranged in various configurations. Gates are logical operators which change a transistor's state to on or off based on the conditions of their inputs. This process can be iterated to accomplish any arithmetic functions on any set of numbers.

It's useful to know these basic computer functions because it helps to internalize the reality that computers at their basic level have no intentionality and do not think in the way that it intuitively feels to us like they do. While we may occasionally adopt the Intentional Stance towards them as a shorthand, using expressions like "Dave's computer wants x" or "my computer is acting churlishly today," this conception is fundamentally incorrect. It's often stated that at their core computers are 'just obeying commands," but even this formulation profoundly overstates their abilities. To say they are obeying implies they rise to some bare minimum level of cognition where words like 'obey' even have meaning, when ultimately computers are just electricity doing what electricity does. Bearing this fact in mind helps us remember that we are the ones with the power to solve whatever problems we encounter.

I learned a great deal about the basic layout of computer components and how they interact with each other in the course. The most helpful insight was the extreme degree of simplicity required of each individual instruction to the CPU in order to amount to something meaningful in the aggregate.
